# Python-Games

As I learn python, I am making games after each section I learn to prove I understand it.
With progressing through my learning journey, I hope to create more and more complex games

The game ideas are from Tech with Tim on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLn3jOsNRVE&t=779s and I try to build them before watching him code, then I have to watch to see where I went wrong :)
